# Weight Refit: Choosing a Transport

Weight refit copies updated policy weights into the rollout model. Choose the
topology first, then select one non-colocated transport with
`policy.generation.refit_transport`.

## Pick a Transport

| Topology | `refit_transport` | Transport | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `colocated.enabled: true` | `null` | CUDA IPC | Policy and rollout workers share GPUs; vLLM uses ZMQ plus CUDA IPC handles and SGLang uses Ray CUDA IPC. |
| `colocated.enabled: false` | `null` | NCCL broadcast | vLLM uses the default full-weight collective; SGLang uses its own weight-update group. |
| `colocated.enabled: false` | `nccl_reshard` | NCCL reshard | Provides the best performance for large models (>100s B models). |
| `colocated.enabled: false` | `vllm_zmq_sparse` | Sparse delta over ZeroMQ | The link is bandwidth-limited and workers can reach a relay over TCP. |
| `colocated.enabled: false` | `vllm_s3_sparse` | Sparse delta through S3 | Workers communicate through shared object storage. |
| `colocated.enabled: false` | `nixl` | NIXL checkpoint engine | The cluster has a fast UCX/RDMA fabric for full-weight refit. |

`null` is the default. The sparse transports read only `refit_cfg.sparse`; NIXL
reads only `refit_cfg.nixl`. Because one selector chooses the transport, sparse
delta and NIXL cannot both be active.

## Constraints

| Transport | Generation backend | Policy backend | Quantization and MoE |
|---|---|---|---|
| Colocated CUDA IPC | vLLM or SGLang | DTensor or Megatron | Uses the generation backend's standard loader. |
| NCCL | vLLM or Megatron | DTensor or Megatron | Uses the standard full-weight loader. |
| SGLang NCCL weight-update group | SGLang | Megatron | Trainer rank 0 broadcasts finalized HF tensors to the engine leaders. |
| NCCL reshard | vLLM | Megatron | Requires matching BF16 or blockwise FP8 precision; Megatron ETP must be 1. Currently supporting Megatron+vLLM backends. |
| Sparse delta | vLLM | Megatron | BF16/FP16, unquantized rollout only. |
| NIXL, full weights | vLLM | DTensor or Megatron | Supports the standard full-weight FP8 loader. DTensor FP8 KV-cache scale transfer is not yet supported. |
| NIXL, sharded experts | vLLM | DTensor or Megatron | Unquantized BF16/FP16 Triton MoE only; FP8/MXFP8 and dynamic expert placement are rejected. |

Non-colocated SGLang generation is supported with a Megatron policy and
`refit_transport: null`; it creates its own NCCL weight-update group. The NIXL
restrictions are on the generation backend; both Megatron and DTensor policy
workers can send weights. Sparse delta is currently limited to GRPO. NIXL is
initialized by the GRPO and distillation setup paths; PPO currently requires
colocated generation.

## Minimal Configuration

Colocated refit needs no transport configuration:

```yaml
policy:
  generation:
    colocated:
      enabled: true
    refit_transport: null
```

For non-colocated NCCL, change the topology and leave the selector unset:

```yaml
policy:
  release_grads_before_refit: false
  generation:
    colocated:
      enabled: false
    refit_transport: null
```

Large quantized exports can temporarily need more memory than training itself.
Set `release_grads_before_refit: true` to drop completed gradient buffers before
the collective export. The same lifecycle can also move the optimizer and clear
Transformer Engine workspaces:

```yaml
policy:
  release_grads_before_refit: true
  offload_optimizer_for_refit: true
  megatron_cfg:
    fp8_cfg:
      enabled: true
      force_clear_fp8_caches: true
  generation:
    colocated:
      enabled: false
    refit_transport: null
```

This option requires the Megatron policy backend and applies only to the default
non-colocated vLLM NCCL collective transport. Unsupported combinations fail
during synchronizer setup. It is disabled by default because CPU offload adds
transfer overhead when the export already fits in trainer GPU memory.

For NCCL reshard with Megatron policy training and vLLM generation:

```yaml
policy:
  generation:
    colocated:
      enabled: false
    refit_transport: nccl_reshard
```

For sparse delta, select one data plane and configure its scope:

```yaml
policy:
  generation:
    colocated:
      enabled: false
    refit_transport: vllm_zmq_sparse  # or vllm_s3_sparse
    refit_cfg:
      sparse:
        delta_compression:
          encoding: xor
        storage:
          s3_bucket: null  # required for vllm_s3_sparse
```

For NIXL, select the checkpoint engine and configure its scope:

```yaml
policy:
  generation:
    colocated:
      enabled: false
    refit_transport: nixl
    refit_cfg:
      nixl:
        update_weights_bucket_memory_ratio: 0.05
        device: cuda
        backend_name: UCX
        release_after_refit: false
        shard_expert_weights: false
```
