"""Weight synchronization interface for NeMo-RL.

WeightSynchronizer is a dedicated abstraction that decouples weight transfer
logic from both PolicyInterface and GenerationInterface. It owns the
transfer of model weights between training and generation components.

Transport-specific implementations (IPC/ZMQ, Ray CUDA-IPC, NCCL collectives,
checkpoint engines) each encapsulate the transfer lifecycle, so algorithm code
never branches on backend type.

Colocated transports (IPC, SGLang colocated) own GPU phase transitions
internally (offload, prepare_for_generation, restore) as part of their
sync_weights() implementation. The NCCL collective transport normally leaves
the policy resident because policy and generation run on separate GPU clusters,
but it can release trainer memory before exports that need additional headroom.
The SGLang disaggregated transport sits in between: it drives the
generation-side phases but leaves the policy resident on its own GPUs.

This interface assumes **global weight updates**: all generation workers
are updated atomically and are always at the same weight version. Per-worker
updates (where different replicas could be at different versions) are not
supported. In async GRPO, heterogeneous weight ages are handled at the
sample level (via replay buffer ``target_weight_versions`` tracking), not
at the synchronizer level.

    Implementations handle the weight transfer for a specific transport

    sync_weights() without knowing which transport is being used or
    whether components are colocated; per-step staleness bookkeeping is
    owned by the training loop.

    Colocated transports own phase transitions internally
    (offload_before_refit, prepare_for_generation, offload_after_refit).

        This method encapsulates the full sync lifecycle:
        1. Prepare the policy side (e.g., offload optimizer state to free GPU memory)

        3. Transfer weights via the transport mechanism
        4. Verify the transfer succeeded
        5. Restore both sides to their ready state

        Step 1 is skipped by default when the policy keeps its own GPUs. NCCL
        collective refit can opt in when export needs additional trainer GPU
        headroom. Steps 2 and 5 are skipped by the NCCL collective and
        checkpoint-engine transports.

        Step 4 (verification) is performed explicitly by the IPC and NCCL
        collective transports, which check ``update_success`` and raise on
        failure. The SGLang transports let the engine RPC errors propagate.

        Reconciling on a schedule is idempotent and converges after a missed or reordered
        notification, and it is the only point where the refit group is provably idle and
        every rank is synchronized -- which matters because the collectives that change
        membership are themselves collectives.

            absent_shards: shard indices whose process cannot take part in a collective
                (see ``GenerationFleetHealth.absent_shards``). Note this is not the
                complement of the serving set: a shard withheld from traffic may still be
                alive and able to refit.
            force: rebuild even when the membership is unchanged. Implementations
                skip a rebuild whose absent set matches what they last built with,
                which is what stops a lost shard costing a rebuild on every
                subsequent step. The recovery path sets this because after an abort

            NoSurvivingShards: if every generation shard is gone, so there is nothing

        The default is a no-op: transports that own no NCCL world of their own -- IPC,
        HTTP, checkpoint-engine -- have no membership to reconcile. It returns None
        rather than False so the controller does not report a refit failure on one of
        them as "no shard could be identified as absent", which would send the reader
