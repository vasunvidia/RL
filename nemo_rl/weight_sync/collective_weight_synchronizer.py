"""NCCL collective weight synchronizer for non-colocated deployments.

Handles weight transfer between policy and generation workers running on
separate GPU clusters using NCCL collective communication. The policy
broadcasts its weights, and generation workers receive them via the
established NCCL process group.

Lifecycle per sync:
  1. policy.offload_before_refit()                 -- optional trainer memory release
  2. policy.broadcast_weights_for_collective()    -- send via NCCL
     generation.update_weights_from_collective()  -- receive via NCCL
  3. Verify transfer success

Policy and generation run on separate GPUs. Trainer offload is disabled by
default, but large quantized exports can opt in when their temporary tensors
need more trainer GPU headroom.

    ``ray.get`` raises on the FIRST future that fails and leaves the rest running. That is

    communicator rebuild is itself a collective, so dispatching ``init_collective`` while
    some ranks are still inside the old refit means they join late or not at all, and the
    rendezvous times out instead of coming up.

    Job 6512153 measured exactly that on the reshard kill variant. Rank 0 gave up on its
    own deadline, the controller went straight into the recovery, and the rebuild began --
    line 963 of the log -- two lines BEFORE rank 1's watchdog fired at all. The surviving
    generation worker then spent 300s twice failing to reach a store that never came up,
    and the run died at 690s having done everything else right.

    Bounded, and swallowing whatever the stragglers raise: they are unwinding from the same
    failure the caller is already holding, and replacing it with a straggler's version

        ranks is what lets the run continue.

        Safe for the broadcast because rank 0 is a trainer and trainers are never
        excluded, so the root is stable across a rebuild and each receiver still slices
        the same byte stream locally.

        Rebuild rather than ``shrink``/``grow``. The pinned NCCL exports both -- checked
